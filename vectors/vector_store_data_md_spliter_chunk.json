You can consider issuing a credit card in our app and enjoy the many benefits of having ONE ZERO bank card. There are non-bank cards, which can be ordered directly from the credit card company. It can be ordered from Isracard or other credit card companies for employees in organizations and workplaces that offers benefits for flying abroad, special conditions, branding and more. A non-bank card is not a bank account. More information about Isracard's corporate card can be found on [Isracard's corporate page](https://marketing.isracard.co.il/clubs/corporate/). Credit card companies provide non-bank services such as financial services, including credit card issuance, clearing services, loans, credit solutions and payment options. These companies provide world-class services to local credit card companies such as Isracard, Max and Cal. A non-bank card can be associated with any bank account you have and from which you want to deduct the card payment. Cards of this type have a line of credit set by the credit card company based on their judgment. On the card's billing day, an instruction is sent to download the charges received on the card to the bank account with which it is associated. For a non-bank card that charges your account with us, on the day the card is charged you must ensure that you have sufficient balance in the account in order to charge the authorization. On a bank card, the full account number appears on the back of the card at the bottom, below the card number. A bank card is a card issued by the credit card company that works with the bank and is debited from the account from which it was issued. This type of card has many advantages with affordable benefits and convenient viewing of data without the need to go to the credit card company's website. With a bank credit card, the credit line is set by the bank itself and not by the credit card company in order to optimize the adjustment to your needs. The bank works with Isracard for the benefit of bank cards. The credit cards issued by Isracard at the bank are debit cards and platinum credit cards. The charges and information on the credit cards are visible to the cardholder, who can view all the charges and their details in the bank application and at the credit card company.",

The transaction charge is definitively descending from the account within 4-5 business days. Charges that appear as \"double\" or \"unrecognized\" are likely temporary (up to 24 hours) and are pending the final approval of the transaction in the bank's systems.

        "text": "* Revolving credit: A type of credit given to a customer when he does not pay the full balance on the card by the time he is charged. The unpaid amount rolls over to the next month, plus interest. This method allows the customer to spread the payment over time, but it can be expensive due to interest accumulation. Bank cards do not have this method of payment.\n* Installment transactions: An option given to the customer to spread the payment for an expensive purchase into several (usually monthly) equal payments. Interest is often charged on future payments, but some promotions can be deployed interest-free. The spread of payments makes large purchases more accessible, but on the other hand may create a strain on the budget in the future.\n* Abnormal Action Verification: A process designed to verify that an unusual action on the card (e.g., an extraordinarily high transaction or unusual location) is performed by the cardholder. Verification can be done through a phone call, a text message with a one-time code, or even a requirement for an ID card. The purpose of the process is to prevent misuse of the card in case of theft or fraud. This verification is most often carried out by the credit card company.\n* Card Number (PAN): The primary credit card identification number, stamped on the physical card and encoded on the magnetic stripe or chip on it. The number includes up to 16 digits - 6 prefix digits identifying the issuer, up to 9 digits of the customer's unique account number, and last check digit. This number is used to verify and execute transactions in Israel and abroad.\n* International credit card: A credit card that enables transactions abroad or in foreign currency, thanks to cooperation between credit card companies and international clearing networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Using an international card may save conversion fees, and is necessary for placing orders from foreign sites or while abroad.\n* Credit threshold: the maximum amount that can be charged in a single transaction without obtaining special approval from the credit company. If the transaction amount exceeds the threshold, individual verification or authorization will be required before the charge is complete. The threshold is intended to protect the customer and the credit card company from exceptional or unauthorized charges, which may indicate theft or misuse of the card.\n* Rechargeable credit card: A credit card that can be deposited (recharged) a sum of money in advance, and redeemed up to the amount charged only. This is a prepaid card and not credit in the usual sense, since it does not give the client the ability to accumulate debt. Such cards are useful for controlling expenses or making safe and limited payments in advance. The bank does not have a prepaid card.\n* Virtual credit card: A credit card that does not physically appear on plastic, but exists digitally. The virtual card is specifically allocated for online shopping only, and its details are stored securely. This card can be used without fear of revealing the real card details, and it is easier to replace it in case of loss or fear of misuse.",

Some companies distribute dividends-that is, shareholders participate in its profits by receiving cash, according to the number of shares they hold.\n* Option: A warrant grants the right to purchase a certain share at a predetermined price and postpone part of the payment to a later date. This right is limited in time - usually 2-5 years (Our bank will have foreign warrants but will not be opened for trading but as a product of a company event).\n* Unlike mutual funds, which usually have a rate set only once each trading day, ETFs are regularly traded on the stock exchange, similar to the way stocks are traded with ask and bid, although some of them have an option to trade like mutual funds at the end of the day.",

This strategy is based on the belief that the security's price will decline, enabling the investor to repurchase it at a reduced cost and pocket the price difference as profit.

Management fees are published in annual terms but are charged daily according to the proportion of the value of the fund's assets. Management fees are embodied in the price of the fund, meaning they are not collected directly from the client's account, but it can affect on the fund yield.\n* Trustee fees – The mutual fund trustee's fees like management fees, is collected daily according to the proportion of the value of the fund's assets. Trust fees are embodied in the principal price, meaning they are not collected directly from the client's account, but it can affect on the fund yield.\n* Distribution fee – payment paid by the fund manager to TASE members (banks, investment houses) through which units of managed funds are shift only. For tracking funds, there is no shift fee.\n* Rate of add – a one-time payment that is added to the price of the fund units at the time of purchase and is calculated as a percentage of the purchase amount.

The designated time is the end time during which a request for the creation or redemption of the Fund's units can be broadcast.\n* Open-end fund -diversified portfolio of pooled investor money that can issue unlimited shares. The fund manager sells shares directly to investors and redeems them as well. These shares are priced daily based on their net asset value. The transactions are carried out through a distributor, the transactions are given during the trading day, but the creation/redemption operation is actually done once a day, at the end of the trading day. When requesting the creation/redemption of units of an open mutual fund, it is not possible to know at what price the transaction will be executed.\n* Closed-end fund - type of mutual fund that issues a fixed number of shares through one initial public offering to raise capital for its initial investments. Its shares can then be bought and sold on a stock exchange, but no new shares will be created, and no new money will flow into the fund. Like many mutual funds, a closed-end fund has a manager overseeing the portfolio and actively buying, selling, and holding assets. Similar to stocks and ETFs, its shares fluctuate in price throughout the trading day.",

If the market moves swiftly and fails to reach your limit price, your instruction may remain unfilled, particularly problematic in volatile markets with rapid price fluctuations.\n* Vulnerability to Price Gaps: Stop-limit instructions may not safeguard against price gaps, where a security's price leaps from one level to another without trades in between. If your limit price isn't met during a price gap, you risk being filled at a significantly worse price than anticipated.\n* Psychological Pressure: Triggered stop-losses can tempt traders to hold positions in hopes of market reversals, leading to emotional decision-making and potential harm to overall trading strategies.\n* Complexity Compared to Other Instructions: Setting up and executing stop-limit instructions can be more intricate than market or limit instructions. Traders must grasp the nuances of setting stop and limit prices and comprehend how these factors interact within the market environment.",
